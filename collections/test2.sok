More level examples:

Demo Level 01

########
#      #
#@ $   #
#   $  #
# . .  #
########

This demo level is trivial, but it suffices to demonstrate
the file-format.
A Sokoban program can add key/value pairs within the notes,
such as:
Author: nn
Website: http://www.nn.net

Solution/Moves
rurrdDuLulDD

The title of a snapshot does not bear any special meaning.
This snapshot just happens to be the best solution found
(so far). The demo-program automatically saves best solutions.

Snapshot 7/0
urrrrdd

This is an example of a snapshot saved by the user.
Later he/she can continue work on this path.

Snapshot 9/2
urrrrddLL*ruulDD

Another snapshot saved by the user. The '*' indicates
current position, i.e., the last moves were taken back,
but are still available for the "redo" function.


Demo Level 02

########
#     .#
#@ $   #
#   $  #
# . *  #
########

Just another trivial demo level. The number of levels in a
file is limited by available memory only.

Solution/Moves
rRRRdrUdlLLulD

Reverse Mode Snapshot 13/6
[rrrd]UUrLLLdrD

This is an example of a reverse mode snapshot.

Reverse mode snapshots always have a leading jump-sequence,
even if it is empty. An example: "[]Ulld...".


Demo Level 03
